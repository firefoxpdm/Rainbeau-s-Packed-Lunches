In ancient times, a fabled colonist by the name of RimRue taught her people the art of packing meals to eat on the go, and all was well in the universe. But during the era of Beta 18, that skill was lost, and pawns had no choice but to moan and cry whenever they had to eat without a table. But rejoice, for now, the stars have aligned, and the technology of packing bagged lunches has been rediscovered!

(Tired of your pawns being in a bad mood because they ate without a table? Now they can turn meals into packed lunches, and eat happily wherever they happen to be.)
